			<h4 class="text-left">What is Subledger?
			</h4>
			<p>Subledger is a modern double-entry ledger and financial report API for mobile and web app developers.
			</p>
			<h4>What is Subledger's purpose?
			</h4>
			<p>Subledger's purpose is to give developers the tools to maintain more accurate, detailed and actionable financial information than they would if they built it themselves.
			</p>
			<h4>Is Subledger difficult to use?
			</h4>
			<p>No. It is easier, less expensive and less risky than building something equivalent. Subledger customers have greatly simplified their code bases, reduced their operational responsibility, and reduced the latency and complexity of their entire financial cycle.
			</p>
			<h4>What standards does Subledger implement?
			</h4>
			<p>Subledger is a modern, respectful implementation of double-entry ledgering and financial report generation. This standard is over 500 years old and is the bedrock upon which all modern accounting standards such as GAAP are built.
			</p>
			<h4>Does Subledger maintain account balances?
			</h4>
			<p>Yes. Subledger account balances are available for any point in time. Account lines are returned with running balances. All balances include total debits, total credits, and net balance. Subledger allows you to make back entries with sub-second forward balance updates, regardless of the number of entries ahead of the back entry.
			</p>
			<h4>Is Subledger auditable?
			</h4>
			<p>Yes. Subledger data is auditable without source code inspection. Everything is in the accounting record, including URL references to source documents.
			</p>
			<h4>Can Subledger provide financial reports?
			</h4>
			<p>Yes. Subledger allows you to assemble and generate balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. Subledger also allows you to create additional reports to meet your needs.</p>
			<h4>How do I access Subledger?
			</h4>
			<p>Subledger provides an iOS app and a browser app for exploring your data. Additionally, your developers can easily present views of the data in Subledger in any way that you, and they, are clever enough to conceive and implement.
			</p>
			<h4>Is Subledger scalable?
			</h4>
			<p>Yes. Subledger was built for web scale applications: billions of transactions per month and beyond.
			</p>
			<h4>Does Subledger store data safely and securely?
			</h4>
			<p>Yes. Subledger runs entirely on Amazon's AWS, which itself is compliant with HIPAA, SOC 1/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 (formerly SAS70), SOC 2, SOC 3, PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, FedRAMP(SM), DIACAP and FISMA, ITAR, FIPS 140-2, CSA and MPAA. Subledger itself has not yet been certified. We take your data security and safety very seriously: when Subledger says it has received your data, it has already been stored in two separate data centers.
			</p>
			<h4>Does Subledger provide disaster recovery?
			</h4>
			<p>Yes. Subledger makes real time backups of transactions as you create them. Our storage system has a stated durability of 99.999999999%. Subledger can optionally mirror your transactions to a separate geographic location. With multiple copies in diverse georgraphic locations, your data is extraordinarily durable.
			</p>
			<h4>Do I need to replace what I've already built?
			</h4>
			<p>No. Subledger can exist alongside anything that's already in place.
			</p>
			<h4>Is accessing my financial data over the internet secure?
			</h4>
			<p>Yes. All communications to and from Subledger are TLS/SSL encrypted which is the modern standard for over the internet security.
			</p>
			<h4>Do you have strong authentication and authorization?
			</h4>
			<p>Yes. We employ a gigantic keyspace (7.3322e+78 combinations) key/secret authentication with support for rolling key updates.
